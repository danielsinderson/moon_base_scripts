# moon_base_scripts
This is a collection of helper scripts for Moon Base Books, as well as some tools to be hosted on the website.


Current tools include The Promptonomicon and The Triggering Town Test. 

The Promptonomicon is a writing prompt generator with options for poetry and short fiction prompts using rules and constraints, tracery grammars, and Markov chains. 

The Triggering Town Test is a simple script that tests a poem for common newbie pitfalls, from checking sentence length variety to checking to see if love is being used as an intransitive verb. It was inspired by "The Triggering Town" by Richard Hugo.
